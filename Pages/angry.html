    <h2>
      Story time !
    </h2>
    <p>
        There‚Äôs this little boy who has a bad temper. His father decides to do something about it and he got a bag of nails and a hammer. He then asked his son to hammer a nail on the fence every time he lost his temper going forward.

        The first day the boy hit 25 nails on the fence. Over the next few days, the number of nails hammered on to the fence started reducing as the boy learnt to control his anger, and finally it went down to zero.
        
        So the day came when the boy didn‚Äôt lose his temper and he was thrilled to tell his father about it.
        
        The father was happy but now he suggested the boy to go ahead and remove one nail for each day that he was able to hold back his temper.
        
        Days passed and the young boy was finally able to get rid of all the nails from the fence. Excited, he went to his father and told him about his new achievement.
        
        The father was very pleased that he was able to control his temper or so long. He congratulated the son and told him how proud he was of his achievement.
        
        The father then told him to observe the fence closely, all the holes specifically.
        
        ‚ÄúYou have done very well, my son. But those holes will remain there forever, and the fence will never look the same again. Similarly, when you say things in anger, you hurt people and leave a scar that won‚Äôt heal easily even if you sorry later. It won‚Äôt matter how many times you say I‚Äôm sorry, the wound will still be there.‚Äù
