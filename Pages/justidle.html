        Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven‚Äôt found it yet, keep looking. Don‚Äôt settle. As with all matters of the heart, you‚Äôll know when you find it.

      Story time !
    </h2>
    <p>
        There was a boy, whose family was very wealthy. One day his father took him on a trip to the country, where he aimed to show his son, how poor people live. So they arrived to a farm of a very poor family, as he considered. They spent there several days. On their return, the father asked his son, did he like the trip.

‚ÄûOh, it was great, dad‚Äù ‚Äì the boy replied. ‚ÄûDid you notice how poor people live?‚Äù ‚ÄûYeah, I did‚Äú- said the boy. The father asked his son to tell in more details about his impressions from their trip‚Äú.

‚ÄûWell, we have only one dog, and they have four of them. In our garden there is a pool, while they have a river that has no end. We‚Äòve got expensive lanterns, but they have stars above their heads at night. We have the patio, and they have the whole horizon. We have only a small piece of land, while they have the endless fields. We buy food, but they grow it. We have high fence for protection of our property, and they don‚Äòt need it, as their friends protect them.‚Äù

The father was stunned. He could not say a word.

Then the boy added: ‚ÄûThank you, dad, for letting me see how poor we are.‚Äù
